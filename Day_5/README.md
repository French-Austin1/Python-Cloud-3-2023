# Python Day 5

## Review of the course material

Today we will be going through a review of the course material and doing exercises to ensure preparedness for the weekend project.

The only new concept today will be installation and use of pylint. Pylint is a module that checks your code for syntax and styling guidelines.  
It can be run using `python -m pylint <filename> --output <output file name>`
