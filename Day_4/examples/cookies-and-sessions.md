## Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent from a website and stored on a user's computer. They are used to store information about the user's session, preferences, and browsing history. In Flask, cookies can be set and accessed using the request and response objects.

## Setting Cookies
To set a cookie in Flask, you can use the set_cookie() method of the response object. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    resp = make_response('Hello, World!')
    resp.set_cookie('username', 'john')
    return resp
```
In this example, we create a response object using the make_response() function and set the username cookie using the set_cookie() method. The first argument is the name of the cookie, and the second argument is its value.

## Accessing Cookies
To access a cookie in Flask, you can use the cookies attribute of the request object. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    username = request.cookies.get('username')
    return 'Hello, {}!'.format(username)
```
In this example, we use the cookies attribute of the request object to access the username cookie. We use the get() method to retrieve its value.

## Deleting Cookies
To delete a cookie in Flask, you can use the delete_cookie() method of the response object. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    resp = make_response('You are logged out!')
    resp.delete_cookie('username')
    return resp
```
In this example, we create a response object using the make_response() function and delete the username cookie using the delete_cookie() method.

## Sessions
Sessions are another way to store data between requests in Flask. Unlike cookies, sessions are stored on the server and are more secure. In Flask, sessions are implemented using a session object that is available through the session attribute.

## Enabling Sessions
To enable sessions in Flask, you need to set a secret key. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'mysecretkey'
```
In this example, we set the secret_key attribute of the app object to a random string. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt the session data.

Storing Data in Sessions
To store data in a session in Flask, you can use the session attribute like a dictionary. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'mysecretkey'

@app.route('/')
def index():
    session['username'] = 'john'
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

In this example, we set the username key in the session to john.

Accessing Data in Sessions
To access data in a session in Flask, you can use the session attribute like a dictionary. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'mysecretkey'

@app.route('/')
def index():
    username = session.get('username')
    return 'Hello, {}!'.format(username)
```

In this example, we use the get() method of the session objectto retrieve the value of the username key in the session.

## Deleting Data from Sessions
To delete data from a session in Flask, you can use the pop() method of the session object. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'mysecretkey'

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.pop('username', None)
    return 'You are logged out!'
```

In this example, we use the pop() method of the session object to remove the username key from the session.

Example: Using Sessions to Implement a Login System
Here's an example of how you can use sessions to implement a login system in Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'mysecretkey'

users = {'john': 'password123', 'jane': 'secret123'}

@app.route('/')
def home():
    if 'username' in session:
        return 'Welcome, {}!'.format(session['username'])
    else:
        return redirect('/login')

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        if username in users and users[username] == password:
            session['username'] = username
            return redirect('/')
        else:
            return render_template('login.html', error='Invalid username or password')
    else:
        return render_template('login.html')

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.pop('username', None)
    return redirect('/login')
```

In this example, we define a dictionary users that maps usernames to passwords. We have three routes:

<dl>
<dt>/:</dt>
<dd>If the user is logged in (i.e., the username key is in the session), they are greeted with a welcome message. Otherwise, they are redirected to the login page.</dd>
<dt>/login:</dt>
<dd>If the request method is GET, the user is presented with a login form. If the request method is POST, the form data is retrieved and checked against the users dictionary. If the username and password match, the username key is set in the session and the user is redirected to the home page. If the username and password do not match, the user is presented with an error message.</dd>
<dt>/logout:</dt>
<dd>The username key is removed from the session and the user is redirected to the login page.
This example shows how sessions can be used to implement a simple login system.</dd>
